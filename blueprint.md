    *   Create basic HTML structures for these pages.
2.  **Create `legal.css`, `memorial.css`, and `support.css`**:
    *   Create basic stylesheets for these pages.
3.  **Update `index.html`, `planning.html`, `caregiving.html`, and `immediate-help.html`**:
    *   Update the navigation to link to the new pages.
