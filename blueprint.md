## **Eonia - A Digital Legacy Platform**

**Purpose & Capabilities:**

Eonia is a web-based platform that helps users prepare for the end of life by providing tools for legal and administrative tasks, as well as creating meaningful memorials. The platform aims to be a comprehensive resource for end-of-life planning, offering a secure and user-friendly experience.

**Style, Design, and Features:**

*   **Design:**
    *   **Color Palette:** The color scheme will be based on a calming and professional palette, with a primary color of `#333`, a secondary color of `#f4f4f4`, and an accent color of `#AEC6CF`.
    *   **Typography:** The platform uses a combination of "Lora" for headings and "Lato" for body text, creating a professional and readable experience.
    *   **Layout:** The layout is clean and modern, with a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Home Page:** The home page provides an overview of the platform's features and guides users to the main sections: "Memorial" and "Legal." The hero section has been updated to display the text "Plan with peace. Live with clarity. Leave with dignity." and a call-to-action button that says "Start Planning Now".
    *   **Legal Section:** This section provides tools for creating a will, managing digital assets, and connecting with legal professionals. It features a grid of `feature-card` components to display the available tools.
    *   **Memorial Section:** This section allows users to create a digital memorial, plan a funeral service, and explore legacy projects. It also uses the `feature-card` component to showcase the different options.
    *   **Web Components:** The platform utilizes a custom web component called `feature-card` to create reusable and encapsulated UI elements for displaying features and tools.

**Current Plan:**

I have updated the hero section of the `index.html` file to match the image provided.
